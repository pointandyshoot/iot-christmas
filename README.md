# iot-christmas

This project uses an Adafruit HUZZAH esp8266 feather with a relay. It connects through adafruit.io so it can be actiavted from my iPhone (using a DO button on IFTTT). I can turn the relay on and off from the start screen. I am using it to control the lights of our christmas tree. The Christmas of Things is here!
